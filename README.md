# Dive-Into-Discovery
 <h2>üîç Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Since the first mechanical devices for ocean cleanup were introduced to combat pollution, technology has significantly evolved to address marine conservation challenges. Today, advanced robotics like HYDROBOT enable us to create sophisticated solutions for ocean preservation. HYDROBOT operates using cutting-edge systems for navigation, debris collection, and data analysis, leveraging parameters such as water salinity, temperature, and current dynamics to optimize its efficiency and environmental impact.

  <h2>üéØ Objectives</h2>
    <p>
        HYDROBOT is an innovative solution designed to combat ocean pollution by efficiently cleaning the ocean. This robot is part of the broader initiative, Dive into Discovery, aimed at exploring and protecting marine ecosystems.
